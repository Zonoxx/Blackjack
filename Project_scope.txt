Project Scope

The game simulates a single player game of blackjack. Its player vs. dealer. 
- For realism the game will simulate a stack of 6 full decks of 52 cards each and replenish the stack when its half empty ->  simple alternative is to create cards randomly.
- The player has a bank of money that he determines at the start and the game keeps track of
- The player can bet money and will receive double his bet when he wins and loose his bet if he looses
- Win condition: player can choose to stop playing at any point, bank will be judged on % of original amount and player will be assessed accordingly
- Losing condition: player bank hits 0

Flow of the game:

Gameplay loop
- player is asked how much would like to wager, maximum bet is 10% of initial amount, minimum bet is 1%
- player will receive card, dealer will receive card, player will receive second card, dealer will receive second card
- game checks for blackjack (if dealer has blackjack player is given the option to surrender, i.e. loosing half his money and round ends)
- player is given information about his cards and the first card of the dealer
- player gets to choose from following actions:
    hit - get another card
    stand - player keeps current cards and dealer evaluates
    double down - player gets one more card and is forced to stand
    (will not be included in first version) split - if inital cards have the same value
- player receives options for more cards until he either stands, hits 21 or busts
- when player stands dealer reveals second card and draws until he has 17 or higher
- result of the game is evaluated
- if player value > dealer value players bet is doubled
- if player value = dealer value player bet is given black
